**Arrays** in JavaScript are special objects that store multiple values as a collection of elements. These values can be of any type, including primitives (like numbers and strings) and objects (like arrays or other objects).


## Change elements in array.
You can add or modify array elements using their index. If you assign a value to a non-existing index, gaps will be filled with undefined.
```js
let arr = [1, 2];  
arr[3] = 4; // Adds a value at index 3  
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, undefined, 4]
```

### Array Methods
**Array methods in JavaScript are built-in functions that allow you to perform various operations on arrays, such as adding or removing elements, searching, sorting, or modifying the array in different ways. These methods provide easy ways to work with arrays without needing to manually iterate or modify them.**
